            <p>
                My name is MD Farhan Israk Faraby.
                I am a dedicated and aspiring Computer Science student at the American International University Of Bangladesh,
                currently in my final semester,
                with a strong academic background reflected in a CGPA of 3 out of 4.
                My educational journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in programming languages such as Python, C++,
                and Java,
                while my current focus is on mastering GoLang.
                I am passionate about technology and have been actively self-learning and working on various programming projects
                to further enhance my skills.
                With a keen interest in DevOps, I am committed to expanding my knowledge in areas like automation, containerization,
                CI/CD, and configuration management to pursue a career as a DevOps engineer.
                I am eager to contribute my skills and enthusiasm to the field of DevOps and make a meaningful impact in the industry.
